# Ex Umbris

Ex Umbris is a strategy/simulation game set in a procedurally generated frontier sector of space. You begin as a minor figure (ship captain, mayor, military officer, or similar) and rise to power through influence, reputation, wealth, and favors. The game emphasizes indirect control and emergent systems, where you shape outcomes by creating objectives and watching autonomous NPCs respond according to their own goals and personalities.
